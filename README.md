# selfie-tendance
An experience in which attendees of an event can give attendance with selfies. We don't want to implement it for classrooms,
but for events within a club/organisation.

## Technologies Used:
* Android SDK + Architecture Components + Kotlin + Android KTX extensions
* Firebase Authentication + Firebase Cloud FireStore for databases
* OpenCV for image recognition

## Key Functions
* Host Shares an event ID
* Guests have a UI for training their selfie data and upload it to a common database where face data is stored 
(since they are in the same community) -> that has been donr before the event
* Guests take selfies within the event, and thus, everyone present is recorded without much formalities
